Backup Script Project

Scenario
Your boss has noticed that you do some very valuable work for the company, and, to
ensure it doesn't get lost, they have suggested that you create a script that you can
use to easily backup all the files in your home directory.
Your boss also thinks that this script will be very useful for others in the office, and
wants you to make sure the script is professionally formatted before sharing it with
your colleagues.
Your Task
Step 1: Create a bash script called backup_script in your ~/bash_course/ directory.
This script should backup all the files in your home directory and save them all in a
.tar archive . Guidance is provided below on how to do this.
When writing your script, remember to add all the core components of your script:
1. The “Shebang” line
2. Commands ( see the "extra guidance" section below )
3. An exit statement with an appropriate exit code.
As well as the 5 pieces of professional information:
1. Author
2. Date Created
3. Last Modified
4. Description
5. Usage
Step 2: Give the script the correct permissions.
Because the script will be shared with others in your organisation, your script should
have the following permissions:
● The file owner (i.e you) should have read, write, and execute permissions.
● Everyone in the file’s group (i.e. your colleagues) should have read and
execute permissions. For security purposes, they should not have write
permissions.
● Everyone else in the organisation should only have read permissions.
Use permissions-calculator.org/ to figure out the correct octal code to use with the
chmod command to achieve this.
Step 3: Run your script multiple times to check that it's working.
You should see it creating multiple backups for you in your ~/bash_course folder.



#! /bin/bash

echo " Author 'Abhi Prabha' "

echo " The script will backup all the files from the home directory into the folder ~/bash_course/ directory"



tar -cf ~/bash_course/my_backup_"$(date +%d-%m-%Y_%H-%M-%S)".tar ~/* 2>/dev/null


exit 0
