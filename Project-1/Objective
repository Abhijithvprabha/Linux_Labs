Project: Automated User Account Creation Script for Linux Servers

As Linux System Administrators, we are working for a fast-growing company that requires us to build and deploy numerous servers. Unfortunately, we are falling behind schedule due to constant interruptions from the help desk, which calls us to create new Linux accounts for users testing the company's latest Linux-based application. To meet our deadline and maintain our sanity, we have collectively decided to develop a shell script that automates the user account creation process. Once the script is complete, we can delegate the task of creating new accounts to the help desk, allowing us to work uninterrupted and complete our server deployments on time.

Objective:
Our objective is to create a shell script that automates the process of creating new user accounts on Linux servers. The script will prompt the help desk for necessary information and generate user accounts with the appropriate permissions.

As a team, we have discussed the necessary functionality and operation of the shell script. Based on our discussions, we have come up with the following requirements:

The script:

    Shall be named "add-local-user.sh".
    Must enforce execution with superuser (root) privileges. If the script is not executed with superuser privileges, it should not attempt to create a user and return an exit status of 1.
    Shall prompt the person executing the script to enter the username (login), the name of the person who will be using the account, and the initial password for the account.
    Should create a new user on the local system using the information provided by the user.
    Must inform the user if the account creation fails for any reason. In case of failure, the script should return an exit status of 1.
    Should display the username, password, and host where the account was created. This information will allow the help desk staff to easily copy the details for further communication.
