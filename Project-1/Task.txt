Project: AutomatedUser Account Creation Script for Linux Servers


As Linux System Administrators, we are working for a fast-growing company that requires us to build and deploy numerous servers.
Unfortunately, we are falling behind schedule due to constant interruptions from the help desk, which calls us to create new Linux accounts for users testing the company's latest Linux-based application.
To meet our deadline and maintain our sanity, we have collectively decided to develop a shell script that automates the user account creation process.
Once the script is complete, we can delegate the task of creating new accounts to the help desk, allowing us to work uninterrupted and complete our server deployments on time.
